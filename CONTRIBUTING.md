# Contributing to the project

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project! Although this is as personal as any project gets ðŸ˜…, I'd love to open it up to the community to allow the opportunity for contributions and collaboration on issues and features. I especially encourage those less familiar with contributing to open source like myself.

## Prerequisites

There isn't really any strict requirements, but here's a couple of things that would be beneficial to have under your belt before contributing to the project.

- Basic React knowledge
- Familiarity with Chakra UI or CSS-In-JS solutions.
- At the very least, familiar with HTML and CSS.

There will likely be a range of issues open at any time and easier issues will be marked with a `good first issue` tag, so look out for that if you're a first time contributor or have recently got into open source.

## Issues

### Submitting an issue

When submitting an issue, please make sure to check other open (and closed) issues to make sure that issue isn't or hasn't already been worked on.

There isn't yet a template for issues, but if you find a bug or some unexpected behaviour, please be as clear as possible as to the nature of the bug and steps to reproduce, if possible.

### Feature requests

New features aren't currently being considered until after the first release of this project, but feel free to share any ideas if you have them. I'm always open to considering cool ideas!

## Development Guide

### Prerequisites

Please ensure you have the latest stable version of `node` and `yarn` on your machine, before following the steps below.

### Running the project locally

1. fork this repo and execute `git clone https://github.com/[your_username]/portfolio-v2.git` in your terminal
2. `cd portfolio-v2`
3. `npm install` or `yarn` to install dependencies
4. `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` to spin up a development server
5. open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to view it in the browser.

## Conventional Commits

For this project, I'm using [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/) to inspire good, clean commit messages and keep inline with the practice of _atomic commits_. I'm not currently sure about other editors, but if you use VSCode there's a very handy [plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits) for this.

Please try to ensure you write in the imperative mood when writing the summary of your commit (e.g. 'add' instead of 'added') and keep it to 50 characters, if possible. You can always elaborate in the body of the commit message! [Here](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/writing-good-commit-messages)'s a handy article about writing good commit messages for those newer to git.

## Pull requests

Once assigned an issue, please make sure to fork the repo and clone/pull code from the `develop` branch as this is most likely to contain the most recent changes which a lot of the issues may relate to.

The same goes for when you want to make a pull request. Please ensure you're comparing to the `develop` branch and not the `main` branch as further checks and tests may be necessary before fully merging to production.

## Support

If there is anything you're unsure of or need clarity on, please don't hesitate to ask. I'd be more than happy to help! You can reach me via [email](gregogun97@gmail.com) or [discord](https://discord.gg/nsBtsHpR).
